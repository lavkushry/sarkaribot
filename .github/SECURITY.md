## Reporting a Vulnerability

The SarkariBot team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for helping us ensure the security of our project.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to us privately by emailing **security@sarkaribot.com**.

You should receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. If you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **A clear description** of the vulnerability.
- **The component** of the project that is affected (e.g., backend API, frontend, scraping engine).
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability, including any proof-of-concept code.
- **The potential impact** of the vulnerability.
- **Any known mitigations** or workarounds.

This information will help us to triage and address the vulnerability as quickly as possible.

### Our Commitment

- We will investigate all reported vulnerabilities promptly.
- We will work with you to understand the scope and impact of the vulnerability.
- We will provide a timeline for a fix and public disclosure.
- We will credit you for your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions.
2.  **Audit code** to find any similar potential problems.
3.  **Prepare a fix** for the vulnerability.
4.  **Release the fix** in a new version of the project.
5.  **Notify the community** through our release notes and security advisories.

We will do our best to handle the bug in a timely manner and will keep you informed of our progress. We will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is available.

## Security Advisories

We will publish security advisories for all confirmed vulnerabilities on the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/sarkaribot/security/advisories) page for our project.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we appreciate all security reports and may offer a token of our appreciation for significant discoveries.
