## ðŸ’¡ Code Generation Guidelines

### Always Include:

#### **Comprehensive Error Handling**
```python
# Example expectation - don't generate this exact code
try:
    # Implementation
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error in {function_name}: {e}")
    # Appropriate fallback or re-raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.critical(f"Unexpected error in {function_name}: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully
```

#### **Detailed Logging**
```python
# Example expectation
logger.info(f"Starting {operation_name} for {entity}")
logger.debug(f"Processing {item_count} items")
logger.warning(f"Potential issue detected: {issue_description}")
```

#### **Type Hints and Docstrings**
```python
# Example expectation
def process_job_data(
    job_data: Dict[str, Any], 
    source_config: SourceConfig
) -> JobPosting:
    """
    Process raw job data into a JobPosting object.
    
    Args:
        job_data: Raw job data from scraping
        source_config: Configuration for the data source
        
    Returns:
        Processed JobPosting object
